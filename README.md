### Introduction:
- **Business Objective**: train machine learning model to predict housing prices based on historical transactions, and demographic/economic data. 

- **Data Sources**: Ames Housing Price dataset, Ames Real Estate dataset, nearby businesses from Google Maps API, school district data scraped via Selenium


### Workflow:
#### 1. EDA
    - uncover actionable insight for preprocessing, feature engineering and model selection
    - (seaborn, plotly express)
#### 2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning Pipeline
    - join various 4 datasets and output processes data in modular pipeline (via Google GCP) 
#### 3. Feature Engineering
    - Maximize meaningful information capture, account for multicollinearity and minimize number of dummified columns for regression phase.
#### 4. Model Selection & Evaluation
    - simple linear regression* 
    - multiple linear regression with penalization 
    - tree based methods

### Next Steps & Considerations: how often do we ingest new data? renormalization and retraining frequency.
